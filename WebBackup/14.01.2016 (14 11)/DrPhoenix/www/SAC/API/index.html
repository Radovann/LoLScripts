			<h1>Sac Helper</h1>
			<p>SacHelper is a simple library who's sole purpose is to eliminate any issues that may occur from your script loading before SAC. This is especially important if you plan to use any of the callbacks or hooks. The library is automatically downloaded by SAC so you simply need to require it at the top of your script. If you're only using a few basic functions, you do not need this.</p>
			<p class="code">require 'SacHelper'</p>
			
			<h1>SacUnits</h1>
			<p>SacUnits are new units created as extensions to BoL units. They are used extensively throughout SAC and are also available to you if you wish to use them. Any internal propeties that you would have no use for are not visible to your scripts, so they only contain data you may find useful. As these units are extensions of BoL units, everything you'd usually expect on a unit is still there.<br/>
			Note that if you are using SAC callbacks, all SacUnits are fully persistant, meaning you can freely save your own data to the units and access it anywhere. You will not break SAC by replacing existing properties, but I would not recommend doing so as your data will be lost.<br/>
			There are 5 types of SacUnit:
			<ol>
				<li>Players</li>
				<li>Minions</li>
				<li>Jungle</li>
				<li>Buildings</li>
				<li>Others (misc) - These are things like wards, pets, barrels etc.</li>
			</ol></p>
			
			<div class="sub_content">
				<h1>Accessing SacUnits</h1>
				<p>For performance reasons, SacUnits are only updated when they are within a specific range.<br/>
				You can access the SacUnit for myHero directly with:</p>
				<p class="code">_G.SAC.myHero</p>
				<p>You can access the "active" SacUnits in the following locations:</p>
				<p class="code">_G.SAC.Players<br/>
				_G.SAC.Minions<br/>
				_G.SAC.Jungle<br/>
				_G.SAC.Buildings<br/>
				_G.SAC.Others</p>
				<p>If you need to access all SacUnits, regardless of whether their data is updated, you can access them in the following locations. Only use if you have a specific reason to do so!</p>
				<p class="code">_G.SAC.SacUnits.Players<br/>
				_G.SAC.SacUnits.Minions<br/>
				_G.SAC.SacUnits.Jungle<br/>
				_G.SAC.SacUnits.Buildings<br/>
				_G.SAC.SacUnits.Others</p>
				<p>The default ranges for SacUnit updates are:</p>
				<p class="code">{player = math.huge, minion = 2500, jungle = 2500, other = 2500, building = math.huge}</p>
				<p>If you wish to override any of these ranges, simply call the following function passing a table containing the relevant overrides:</p>
				<p class="code">-- Update jungle monsters at any distance<br/>
				_G.SAC:SetUpdateRange({jungle = math.huge})</p>
				<p>Consider performance implications on less powerful machines before setting 'minion' and 'other' ranges too high.</p>
			</div>

			</div>
			
			<h1>Callbacks</h1>
			<p>There are a number of new callbacks available, as well as replacements for the default BoL callbacks. Any callback that replaces a BoL callback has the exact same functionality, with the exception that all units returned by the callback will be SacUnits, and the callback will never be triggered if any of the objects are invalid. Callbacks without params are the same unless otherwise stated.</p>
			
			<div class="sub_content">
				<h1>Using Callbacks</h1>
				<p>If you want to use any of these callbacks, it's important to require SacHelper from above.</p>
				<p class="code">SAC:Bind("CallbackName", function(params) end)</p>
				
				<h1>OnLoad</h1>
				<p>The OnLoad callback will always be called when both your script and SAC have loaded. If SAC loads instantly and your script loads after 30 seconds, it'll be called as soon as your script loads. If your script loads instantly and SAC loads after 30 seconds, it'll be called as soon as SAC loads.</p>
				<p class="code">SAC:Bind("OnLoad", function()<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;print("SAC must be loaded, safe to initialise stuff")<br/>

			<h1>Hooks</h1>
			<p>Hooks allow you to inject your own code into some of SAC's decision making processes and alter the result.</p>
			
			<div class="sub_content">
				<h1>Using Hooks</h1>
				<p class="code">SAC:Hook("HookName", function(params) end)</p>
				
				<h1>Available Hooks</h1>
				<p class="code">AllowedToMove() - Return false to stop SAC from moving<br/>
				AllowedToAttack() - Return false to stop SAC from attacking<br/>
				<br/>
				KillableMinion(minion) - Return false to stop SAC considering this minion killable (auto attack last hit)<br/>
				AlmostKillableMinion(minion) - Return false to stop SAC pausing farm to wait for this minion to be killable<br/>

				-- SAC won't allow any player other than Jax to be targeted in orbwalk range<br/>
				SAC:Hook("OrbRangeTargetSelect", function(player) return player.isJax end)<br/>
				<br/>
				-- SAC will never move when myHero isn't on the screen (even if move position is on the screen)<br/>
				SAC:Hook("AllowedToMove", function() return myHero.isOnScreen end)</p>
			</div>
			
			<h1>Functions</h1>
			<p>Most functions will only work once SAC has successfully loaded and authed. Calling them before this won't throw any errors, but won't do anything either.<br/>
			This is <b>not an issue if you're using the OnLoad callback</b>. Otherwise, you can manually check:</p>
			<p class="code">SAC.Loaded -- Script loaded<br/>
			SAC.Authed -- Script authed</p>
			
			<div class="sub_content">
				<h1>Using Functions</h1>
				<p>All functions can be called as follows:</p>
				<p class="code">SAC:FunctionName(params)</p>
				
				<h1>Script Control Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:DisableMovement() -- Disables movement but allows SAC to continue to farm correctly by holding position to cancel attack aggro when necessary.<br/>
				:HardDisableMovement() -- Disables movement and SAC won't manage your attack aggro. Lane clearing will suck as the game will blindly continue to attack.<br/>
				:EnableMovement() -- Cancels both of the above functions, re-enabling all movement.<br/>
				:AttacksEnabled(true/false) -- Enable or disable attacks<br/>
				:OrbwalkMode() -- Disables skill farm, jungle skills and champion skills<br/>
				:DisableSkillFarm() -- Disables all skill farming, including under towers<br/>
				:EnableSkillFarm() -- Re-enables all skill farm<br/>
				:DisableJungleSkills() -- Disables all skill use on jungle monsters<br/>
				:EnableJungleSkills() -- Re-enables all skill use on jungle monsters<br/>
				:DisablePlayerSkills() -- Disables casting any skills on champions<br/>
				:EnablePlayerSkills() -- Re-enables casting skills on champions<br/>
				:ForceMode("AutoCarry"/"MixedMode"/"LaneClear") -- Force the given mode. Call again with nil to disable.<br/>
				:ChannelDetectionEnabled(true/false) -- Enabled by default. If disabled, SAC will no longer pause while channeling.<br/>
				:PreferredOrbwalkPoint(point) -- SAC will orbwalk to this point, but only when it was going to move anyway. Options like "mouse over hero to stop move" can still be used by the user.<br/>
				:ForceOrbwalkPoint(point) -- SAC will orbwalk to this point. It will ignore user preferences and will not block off-screen movement commands.<br/>
				:SetUpdateRange(overrides) -- Set the update ranges for different SacUnit types. Explained above in SacUnit section.</p>
			
				<h1>Target Control Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:SetTSRange(range) -- Set the range that SAC can search for enemies outside of orbwalk range. By default this is the highest range of SAC's supported skills for this champion.<br/>
				<br/>
				:SetPreferredTarget(player) -- When SAC is specifically looking for a champion target, it will prioritise this target if it is in range for the actions the script wants to perform. This is the ideal function to use, as it will allow the user to still perform any action they want such as farming, target lock etc, but your target will be prioritized over any other champion when SAC is choosing a champion target.<br/>
				<br/>
				:ForcePreferredTarget(player, range) -- SAC will always target this champion when it's within the range you set. This will override all other target selection and in doing so will disable farming, focus selected target, target lock and more. When the target is not within range, normal functionality resumes.<br/>
				<br/>
				:ForceTarget(player) -- This is absolute. SAC will not target anything other than this champion no matter where they are, whether they're dead, not visible etc.<br/>
				<br/>
				:UnlockTarget() -- Cancels any of the above target modifications.<br/>
				<br/>
				:GetTarget() -- Returns a SacUnit and a reason. The reason is why this unit is targeted, and can be any of the following:<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"forced" -- This target was forced using 'ForcePreferredTarget' or 'ForceTarget' above.<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"targetlock" -- This unit is targeted because the user has them selected and is holding down left mouse button. Target lock is absolute unless the user releases the mouse button or the target dies.<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"priomisc" -- SAC is targeting a misc unit such as a pet, ward or barrel. The user is using Lane Clear or Custom Mode with "prioritise misc objects" enabled.<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"farmkill" -- SAC wants to last hit this minion<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"farmwait" -- SAC is waiting a short while for this minion to become last hittable<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"farmkillcombo" -- SAC is performing a skill/AA farm combo on this minion for the last hit<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"farmpushcombo" -- SAC is performing a lane clear skill/AA combo to push the lane<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"farmtowercombo" -- SAC is performing a skill/AA combo to last hit this tower minion<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"farmtowerpushcombo" -- SAC is using some free time under the tower to prepare caster minions etc<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"focusselected" -- This unit is targeted because the user has them selected, and the unit meets their "Focus Selected Target" settings<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"enemy" -- An enemy champion is being targeted and has been selected by SAC target selector<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"clear" -- This minion has been targeted for lane clear. It will be attacked to push the lane.<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"jungle" -- A jungle monster is targeted</p>
				
				<h1>Mode Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:AnyModeActive() -- Returns whether any mode is currently active in SAC.<br/>
				:GetActiveMode() -- Returns a string for the current active mode. nil if no mode active.<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"AutoCarry" -> Auto Carry is active<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"MixedMode" -> Mixed Mode is active<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"LaneClear" -> Lane Clear is active<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;"LastHit" -> Last hit no longer exists and has been replaced by Custom Mode. The user can choose which mode your script receives when they use Custom Mode. For example, they can configure Custom Mode as another Auto Carry type mode and make your script think Auto Carry is active.<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;The "LastHit" option actually just allows the user to indicate to you that they do not want to attack enemies. The user can only set this in Custom Mode.</p>
			
				<h1>Orbwalking Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:CanMove() -- Returns false when you are attacking. Same as myHero.moveReady<br/>
				:CanAttack() -- Returns whether your champion can physically attack now, but does not necessarily mean that SAC will attack.<br/>

				:IsKillable(minion) -- Returns whether the minion is killable with an auto attack and meets all requirements to be attacked (range etc).<br/>
				:IsAlmostKillable(minion) -- Returns whether the minion will very soon be killable with an auto attack, and is not very far from orbwalk range.<br/>
				:IsValidLaneClearTarget(minion) -- Returns whether it's safe to attack this minion without worrying about losing the last hit. Considers auto attack damage only.<br/>
				:CanExecuteMinion(minion) -- Returns whether this minion can be executed with Spoils of War (Relic shield items). Requires you to have a stack of Spoils of War.</p>
				
				<h1>Skill Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:LoadPrediction(predictionName) -- Loads the chosen prediction if it's not already loaded. Predictions will always be loaded before they are used, but it's better to ensure the prediction is already loaded rather than load it when trying to cast a skill for the first time.<br/>
				<br/>
				:GetPrediction(predictionName, target, data) -- Returns castPosition, hitChance from the selected prediction.<br/>
				<br/>
				predictionName can be:<br/>

				&#160;&#160;&#160;[optional] collisionMinions -> true/false<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;[optional] collisionChampions -> true/false<br/>
				}</p>
				
				<h1>Var Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:UniqueChampionsKilled() -- Returns the number of unique champions you have killed. Persistant during reloads, but SAC had to be loaded when the kill happened.<br/>
				:GetSpoilStacks() -- Returns the number of Spoils of War stacks you have, if any.<br/>
				:GetGamePhase() -- 1 = Early, 2 = Mid, 3 = Late. This is a user-controlled variable. Some users won't use this feature, and game phase will always be 1.<br/>
				:GetGamePhaseString() -- "Early" / "Mid" / "Late"<br/>
				<br/>
				:GetTowerCount() -- Returns a table. Values indicate how many towers are remaining in a given position. Example: GetTowerCount().Ally.Top<br/>
				&#160;&#160;&#160;{<br/>

				&#160;&#160;&#160;}</p>
				
				<h1>Random/Utility Functions</h1>
				<p class="code">:ValidTarget(unit, distance) -- Similar to normal ValidTarget except contains some humanizer checks from user settings such as minimum time visible.<br/>
